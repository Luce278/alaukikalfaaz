muddat huī hai yaar ko mehmāñ kiye hue
josh-e-qadah se bazm charāġhāñ kiye hue

kartā huuñ jam.a phir jigar-e-laḳht-laḳht ko
arsa huā hai dāvat-e-mizhgāñ kiye hue

phir vaz'-e-ehtiyāt se rukne lagā hai dam
barsoñ hue haiñ chaak garebāñ kiye hue

phir garm-nāla-hā-e-sharar-bār hai nafas
muddat huī hai sair-e-charāġhāñ kiye hue

phir pursish-e-jarāhat-e-dil ko chalā hai ishq
sāmān-e-sad-hazār namak-dāñ kiye hue

phir bhar rahā huuñ ḳhāma-e-mizhgāñ ba-ḳhūn-e-dil
sāz-e-chaman tarāzi-e-dāmāñ kiye hue

bāham-digar hue haiñ dil o diida phir raqīb
nazzāra o ḳhayāl kā sāmāñ kiye hue

dil phir tavāf-e-kū-e-malāmat ko jaa.e hai
pindār kā sanam-kada vīrāñ kiye hue
	The heart once again sets out to circle of street of disgrace 
	having deserted the temple of pride and self-importance 
		The infliction on the fact that it's the heart(dil) who's going to the street and not him seems like he has become a mere vessel to carry out the demands and whims of the heart. It seems that he(the poet) doesn't have any agency of his own. 
		The use of "phir" suggests that he has done this before that is went to the beloved's street even though he know what it would result in. 
		The word tawaf-e-ku-malamat has been used masterfully here, the others think that street has done given him nothing except for humiliation and disrespect but the heart not paying any attention to it still drives the poet to that street to circle around implying that the heart reveres the beloved as divinity and hence circles around her house/street as one does in Kaaba. This inner tug of war between the heart and the mind is trademark of Ghalib's poetry. (Read more about that here- [[Essays/The internal conflict of Ghalib\|The internal conflict of Ghalib]] 
		In the second line the poet is acknowledging and lamenting over the fact that he's deserting the temple of pride and self-respect only to go back to the street where he has been humiliated multiple times. 
		In Conclusion- 
		It seems that the poet is lamenting over the fact that he has become completely helpless against the impulses of the heart and more or less has given in completely to it.
