मैं कब से ढूँढ़ रहा हूँ  
अपने प्रकाश की रेखा  
तम के तट पर अंकित है  
निःसीम नियति का लेखा  
  
देने वाले को अब तक  
मैं देख नहीं पाया हूँ,  
पर पल भर सुख भी देखा  
फिर पल भर दुख भी देखा।  
	This poem, with its profound simplicity, speaks to a deeply human experience: the unending cycle of joy and sorrow. The poet is grappling with the **futility and repetitiveness of each fleeting moment**, as happiness and sadness arrive and depart with equal speed. This constant oscillation between emotional states has left him weary, and he yearns to **break free from this relentless cycle**.
	He is searching for meaning, for a reason behind his alternating moments of pleasure and pain. He seeks to justify his suffering as well as his happiness, but finds no answers. The poem captures this feeling of **existential unease**, the profound sense of not knowing anything.
	This verse in particular reminds me of a sher by Ghalib- 
	  *Naqsh fariyadi hai kiski sohkhi-e-tahrir ka
	  kaghazi hai pairahan Har paikar-e-tasveer ka*
	  This same metaphor(this whole world as a painting and Bhagwan as the creator of that painting) is used in this poem in verse 4.
	  Both the couplets are capturing an emotion of angst an existential uneasiness of not knowing the purpose of life and the creator.   
   
किस का आलोक गगन से  
रवि शशि उडुगन बिखराते?  
किस अंधकार को लेकर  
काले बादल घिर आते?  
  
उस चित्रकार को अब तक  
मैं देख नहीं पाया हूँ,  
पर देखा है चित्रों को  
बन-बनकर मिट-मिट जाते।  
	The poet is talking about an invisible force which he is unable to see, but he is able to observe the effects of that entity on everything hence through inference it's existence is proved but he is unable to obtain any more information about it except for the thing that it exists. 
	The imagery used in this verse is similar to that used by Ghalib in his famous couplet which i have mentioned above also- 
	*Naqsh fariyadi hai kiski sohkhi-e-tahrir ka
	kaghazi hai pairahan Har paikar-e-tasveer ka.
	
	Kalidasa talks about something similar 2 millennium before. In his play Abhigyan Shakuntalam, there is a prasang where Matali has grabbed the Vidushak Mandavya by the throat and the King can't see him but can only hear the scream of the Vidushak. This imagery that an invisible force has grabbed us is so nuanced and so profound that it is relevant to this day, be it in a sociological sense or be it in a existential sense. 
  
फिर उठना, फिर गिर पड़ना  
आशा है, वहीं निराशा  
क्या आदि-अन्त संसृति का  
अभिलाषा ही अभिलाषा?  
  
अज्ञात देश से आना,  
अज्ञात देश को जाना,  
अज्ञात अरे क्या इतनी  
है हम सब की परिभाषा?  
  
पल-भर परिचित वन-उपवन,  
परिचित है जग का प्रति कन,  
फिर पल में वहीं अपरिचित  
हम-तुम, सुख-सुषमा, जीवन।  
  
है क्या रहस्य बनने में?  
है कौन सत्य मिटने में?  
मेरे प्रकाश दिखला दो  
मेरा भूला अपनापन ।
